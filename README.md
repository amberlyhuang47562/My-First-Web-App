Self Introduction Web Page

The web app consists of three pages; the main page, future endeavours page, and the socials page, each containing information to get to know me a little more. And at the top of each page, there are navigation lines to bring the user to the other pages and back.

The main page is purely there for decoration, it does not have a very important purpose except greeting the user with a lovely image from the Corpse Bride because I only watched the film recently and I loved it. The future endeavours page I share what I have been thinking of doing in post-secondary, which might not be up to date anymore because I keep changing my mind. And lastly the socials page is a page just of my contact information.
