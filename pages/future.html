        <p>  I feel as though my whole life has always been about "what do you want to be in the future?" But even with all that anticipation in my life, I still don't know. 
        <br> I like to call myself an "all-rounder" for being good at multiple things but it is just a way to make myself feel better about how I have no clue what I want to pursue. 
        <br> The job I want the most is something that has thrill but I can still enjoy. As of right now I am most interested in being an architect but I think I would also be open to being any type of scientist. 
        <br> These are my options until I narrow it down. I just want a job that is exciting every single day. </p>
